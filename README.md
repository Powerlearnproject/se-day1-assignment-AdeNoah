Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the discipline involving the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in the development of high quality software systems. Software engineering is important in creating software applications and systems that power many aspects of modern life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include;
i. The development of programming languages
ii. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline
iii. the rise of agile methodologoies 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases of Software Development Life Cycle are:
i. REQUIREMENTS - this stage involves gathering necessary informations on users needs and the system requirements
ii. DESIGN - design means creating the designs of the required software
iii. IMPLEMENTATION - this is the actual building stage of the application software by building it to meet the specifications using codes
iv. TESTING - at this stage many tests are carried out on the software in order to ensure that it meets the required standards of ffunctionality 
v. DEPLOYMENT -  deployment simply means to release a softare to customers for usage
vi. MAINTAINANCE - here there is continuous work done after deployment in order to ensure that support, updates and enhancements are available to the software


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is a sequential approach to software development, it flows downward just like a waterfall while theagile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach in software development focused on flexibility collaboration and response to changes

an example of where waterfall methodology will be used is in a project with well defined rerequirements and minimal changes like in developing a software for a satelite system 

a scenario where agile methodology will be implemented is in projects which are required to evolve and change rapidly like when developing a social media platform or a mobile app 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i. A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER - is responsible for writing the codes and inplementation of the software 
ii. A QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER - he designs and execurting tests in order to ensure the software's quality 
iii. PROJECT MANAGER - the project manager is responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
